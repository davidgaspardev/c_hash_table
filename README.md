# Hash Table

In computing, a **hash table** (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a **hash function** to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Is JSON hash table ?

**JSON** supportd dictionary type elements. People may refer to these as `hash tables`, which are a type of data structure. Referring to JSON dictionaries as `hash tables would` be technically incorrect, however, as there is no particular data structure implementation associated with the JSON data itself.
